# TriviaGame
Homework assignment #4

Notes on Development
1.  I didn't see a lot of variety online on how people solved this one, and while I wanted to stack the questions on the screen as they came, I couldn't figure out how to do it.  Instead I stacked the answer history.
2.  I wanted to put in a way to pick the number of questions and difficulty level to pull a new set of questions from a trivia game api using ajax but I couldn't figure that one out based on the Movie App program we did in class.  The format of the objects are pretty much the same but I couldn't get there.
3.  I suspect the way to randomize the questions so that a certain sort order wasn't the same each time is to randomize the array objects each game.  Or, do do some kind of for loop that use the math. functionality to place them on the screen in orders other than just 0,1,2,3 every time.
